/**
 * Allows one to use pattern matching (think, "a switch statement with more power") to map one or more input event(s)
 * (e.g. key event, mouse event, etc.) to a given behavior (a block of code to execute) in a declarative style
 * with self-documenting code.
 *
 * To understand how to use this library well, read through the javadoc of
 * {@link fx.input.EventPattern}, {@link fx.input.InputHandler} and then
 * {@link fx.input.InputMap} in that order. Once these are understood, one should read the
 * javadoc of {@link fx.input.template.InputMapTemplate}.
