# fx.misc
A fork of the FxMisc (and related) projects

This is a refactoring of the FxMisc projects relevant to RichTextFX.  Mostly, it's been about reworking the code to Java 16 but some repackaging and restructuring has also been done.  Also, the tests have been updated to junit5.  Code for RichTextFX is not yet included but will be in the next update.
